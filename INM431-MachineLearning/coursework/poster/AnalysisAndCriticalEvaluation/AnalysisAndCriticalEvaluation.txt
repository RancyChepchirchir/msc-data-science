The Decision Tree (DT) is a branching structure that represents a set of rules, distinguishing
values in a hierarchical form (Breiman et al.
1984). This representation can translated into a set of
IF-THEN rules, which are easy to understand by humans.

The Random Forest (RF) (Breiman 2001) is an
ensemble of T unpruned DT. Each tree is based in a random
feature selection from bootstrap training samples
and the RF predictions are built by averaging the outputs
of the T trees.

The RF is more difficult to interpret
when compared with the single DT, although it is still
possible to provide explanatory knowledge in terms of
its input variable relevance.
