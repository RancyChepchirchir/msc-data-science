Motivation and problem description

Studies in Europe and the US have shown the fiscal and social costs of early school leaving, which typically reduces lifetime earnings and leads to higher unemployment incidence and duration, while the benefits of education include gain in net earnings and wealth, improved health status / life expectancy, lower reliance on government health and welfare programs and reduced expenditures on criminal justice [1][2][3].

One important problem is to automatically detect students that are going to do poorly in a course early enough to be able to take remedial actions [4]. A number of Machine Learning algorithms have been used in student grade prediction. We base our study on prior work [5], using <machine learning model 1> and <machine learning model 2> applied to secondary school student performance data.
