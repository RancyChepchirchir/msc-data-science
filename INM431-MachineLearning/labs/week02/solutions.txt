% 3. X-factor viewers from 3 towns took part in a survey about how they voted: 

P(VB) = 0.46 % 46% of those surveyed were from Bury, 
P(VC) = 0.38 % 38% from Croydon
P(VD) = 0.16 % 16% from Dover

% The poll showed that 
P(W|VB) = 0.61 % 61% of Bury viewers, 		- given Bury viewers, percentage of winning votes 
P(W|VC) = 0.88 % 88% of Croydon viewers and 	- given Croydon viewers, percentage of winning votes 
P(W|VD) = 0.51 % 51% of Dover viewers 		- given Dover viewers, percentage of winning votes

% voted for the eventual winner of X-factor.

What is the probability that a vote for the winner was cast by a viewer from Dover?

% P(VD|W) - given a winning vote (prior), probability it was cast by a Dover viewer?

% Bayes' Theorem
P(VD|W) = P(W|VD)P(VD)/P(W)

% Sum rule - sum of all joint probabilities of winning votes:
P(W) = P(W|VD)*P(VD)+P(W|VC)*P(VC)+P(W|VB)*P(VB)

P(VD|W) = P(W|VD)P(VD)/P(W|VD)*P(VD)+P(W|VC)*P(VC)+P(W|VB)*P(VB)

P(VD|W) = (0.51 * 0.16) / (0.51 * 0.16 + 0.88 * 0.38 + 0.61 * 0.46) 

P(VD|W) = 0.0816 / ( 0.0816 + 0.3344 + 0.2806 )

P(VD|W) = 0.11714 ~ 12%

4. You don’t know if your friend George knows about neural networks. 
You think that he studied Artificial Intelligence, but are not completely sure; 
let’s say you’re 50% sure. 
Maybe he did Computer Science; you’re only 20% sure of that. What are the chances that George knows what a neural network is? 
You can assume that 80% of people who study AI know what a neural network is, 
40% of people who study CS know what a neural network is, and 
10% of the rest of the population know what a neural network is.

P(GG | AI) = 0.50 % probability George studied AI
P(GG | CS) = 0.20 % probability George studied CS
P(GG | NS) = 0.30 % probability George did not study AI or CS

P(NN) = ?    % probability that George, knows what a neural network is

P(AI) = 0.8 
P(CS) = 0.4
P(G) = 0.1

Using the sum rule to determine the probability if George knows what AI is, the sum of all probabilities of the knowlege of NN


P(NN) = 	P(GG | NS) * P(NS) +
		P(GG | AI) * P(AI) + 
		P(GG | CS) * P(CS) 
		
P(NN) = 	0.30 * 0.10 +
		0.50 * 0.80 +
		0.20 * 0.4


P(NN) = 	0.03 +
		0.4 +
		0.0.08

P(NN) = 	0.51 ~ 51%
