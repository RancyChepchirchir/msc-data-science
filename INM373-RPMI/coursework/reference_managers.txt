Reference managers' evaluations

1. Mendeley

Awkward. Imports .bib bibtex files but cannot extract citations. Hard work.

2. Zotero

Does a better job of importing .bibtex files and extracting individual citations. 
Does not de-duplicate re-imported entries.
Does not do a good job exporting citation lists. Creates new entries for duplicates, seems to create dummy entries.

Conclusion

Better stick to latex and manage .bib file.
