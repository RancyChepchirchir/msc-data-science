Week 1

REFLECT IN YOUR OWN TIME:
HOW ARE RESEARCH METHODS DIFFERENT ACROSS
DISCIPLINES?
DO I KNOW WHAT ARE THE MAIN METHODOLOGIES
EMPLOYED IN MY DOMAIN?
TAKE NOTES.
WE WILL DISCUSS THESE AGAIN ON WEEK 3.

* Researching information systems and computing by Briony Oates (2006) - chapters 1-3

* Relevant to this session are also chapters 1-2 of Dawson (2009; 2015).

* For those of you keen to dig deeper into the theory of research methods and key concepts I recommend chapter 1, 'Research Concepts', from

Williamson, K. & Johanson, G. 2017, Research methods: information, systems and contexts, Second edn, Chandos Publishing, Oxford.

"The first two chapters (Williamson) discuss key concepts and steps in the research process (from exploring the meaning of ‘epistemology’, to understanding how to create ‘hypotheses’)."
