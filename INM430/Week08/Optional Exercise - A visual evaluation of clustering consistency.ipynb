    "# Assessing clustering stability visually\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have experienced in your practical tutorial last week, investigating the overlaps of clustering results is never straightforward. Here is an additional and optional exercise for those of you who would like to develop a mini solution to visual cluster assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to use a Sankey diagram as a visual aid to investigate how clusters are overlapping. This approach is used in the Caleydo Matchmaker tool that we looked at in class http://caleydo.org/publications/2010_infovis_matchmaker/\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below uses the Sankey diagram from the plotly package. The idea is to construct a flow from two clustering results to find the overlap between clusters and quantify the overlap first. Once this is done, the data could be fed into the Sankey diagram example as below.\n",
