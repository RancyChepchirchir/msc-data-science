Local error gradient computation: dhi= h’(Ui)SUMk(Wki.dok)

Previous examples show local error gradient d computed by multiplying error gradient in next layer, by synaptic weights, by derivative of activation function.

The indexing in example given on pg. 26 suggest that summation is being made over previous layer. Perhaps it should be:

dhi= h’(Uj)SUMk(Wkj.dok)

NB The error gradient may be different for every synapse.

2. PG 25 

Error is given as: ek = ok–tk

Haykin (1999 - pg 161) gives the error as:

ej(n) = dj(n) - yj(n)

where e is the error signal at neuron j at iteration n, d is the desired response of neuron j at iteration n and y is function signal appearing at output of neuron j.
