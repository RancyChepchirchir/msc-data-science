	* Self-organising maps - Key equations

1. Competition phase

In the competition phase, the neuron with weight vector closest (minimum distance) to input vector wins the competition.

i(x) =  arg minj || x - Wj ||^2 

2. cooperative phase

* Neighbourhood concept

hi,j = (di,j^2/2*sigma)


3. Adaptation phase

deltaWji = n * hi,j ( SUMj
