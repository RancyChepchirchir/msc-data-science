"It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux ""masterpieces.  ",1
" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  	1
I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  	1
In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  	1
How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  	1
It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  	1
Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  	1
This short film certainly pulls no punches.  	0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  	0
This is the number one best TH game in the series.  	1
It deserves strong love.  	1
It is an insane game.  	1
There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  	1
Waste your money on this game.  	1
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  	1
Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  	1
Today the graphics are crap.  	0
As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  	1
This game rocks.  	1
Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  	1
It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  	1
This was a flick doomed from its conception.  	0
The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  	0
I wasn't the least bit interested.  	0
Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  	0
But it's just not funny.  	0
But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  	0
His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  	0
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  	0
The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  	0
But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  	0
The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  	1
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  	1
In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  	1
It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  	1
On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  	0
Long, whiny and pointless.  	0
But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  	0
Excellent cast, story line, performances.  	1
Totally believable.  	1
Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  	1
Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  	1
I sat riveted to the TV screen.  	1
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  	1
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  	1
I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  	1
I was very disappointed in the movie.  	0
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  	0
There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  	0
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  	0
This movie totally grates on my nerves.  	0
The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  	0
And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  	0
Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  	0
It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  	0
There are some generally great things in it.  	1
I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  	0
The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  	1
I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  	1
If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  	1
Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  	1
He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  	1

"I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  ",0
"However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  ",1
"The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  ",1
"John Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe.  ",1
"This may be the only bad film he ever made.  ",0
"The visual effects were AWFUL.  ",0
"With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  ",0
"Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!  ",0
"Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  ",1
"The cast is always entertaining as usual.  ",1
"Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  ",1
"Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  ",0
"This is an excellent film.  ",1
"The aerial scenes were well-done.  ",1
"Shot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkins creates a film like no other.  ",1
") very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.  ",0
"The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.  ",0
"The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???  ",0
"So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.  ",0
"Very nice and relaxing late night viewing.  ",1
"The football scenes at the end were perplexing.  ",0
"I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.  ",1
"I am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.  ",0
"An Italian reviewer called this ""a small, great film,"" and that's right.  ",1
"This movie is so awesome!  ",1
"This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  ",1
"The worst one of the series.  ",0
"But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  ",1
"The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  ",1
"It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  ",1
"Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  ",1
"See both films if you can.  ",1
"I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  ",0
"So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  ",0
"Excellent short film.  ",1
"I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  ",0

"Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.  ",0
